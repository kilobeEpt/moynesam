# XSS Vulnerability Analysis for "Мой Не Сам" Portal (Node.js, Local and Render Deployment)

## Overview
The "Мой Не Сам" cleaning service portal, developed with Node.js and deployed both locally and on Render, handles user inputs across various forms (registration, login, order submission, admin content management). This analysis evaluates potential XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) vulnerabilities and mitigations in the context of local development and Render deployment.

## Potential XSS Vulnerabilities
1. **User Input Fields**:
   - Registration: `login`, `full_name`, `phone`, `email`.
   - Order Submission: `address`, `phone`, `service_type`, `other_service`.
   - Admin Panel: `new-service`, `home_title`, `home_subtitle`, `about_content`.
   - Unsanitized inputs could allow injection of malicious scripts.

2. **Displayed Data**:
   - User data in the admin panel (e.g., `full_name`, `address`) and frontend content (e.g., `home_title`, `about_content`).
   - If unescaped, these could execute scripts in users' browsers.

3. **API Responses**:
   - JSON responses from the backend could include unsanitized data, leading to reflected XSS.

4. **Local Development Risks**:
   - Local testing may involve less stringent security configurations, increasing XSS risk if inputs are not sanitized.

## Mitigations Implemented
1. **Input Sanitization**:
   - The `sanitize-html` library sanitizes all user inputs before storage in the SQLite database.
   - Applied to fields like `login`, `full_name`, `address`, `service_type`, `home_title`, etc.
   - Example: `const sanitizedLogin = sanitizeHtml(login);`
   - Removes or escapes potentially malicious HTML/JS code.

2. **Output Encoding**:
   - Frontend uses `textContent` instead of `innerHTML` for data display, preventing script execution.
   - Example: `document.getElementById('home-title').textContent = content.home_title;`

3. **JWT Authentication**:
   - JWT tokens secure API endpoints, ensuring only authenticated users can submit data.
   - Admin actions are restricted to the `adminka` user, reducing unauthorized access.

4. **Database Security**:
   - Parameterized SQLite queries prevent SQL injection, which could otherwise inject malicious data.
   - Example: `db.run('INSERT INTO Users (login, password) VALUES (?, ?)', [login, password]);`

5. **Render-Specific Mitigations**:
   - Render’s environment variables secure sensitive data (e.g., admin password).
   - Persistent disk storage ensures SQLite database integrity.

## Potential Risks
1. **Incomplete Sanitization**:
   - Misconfigured `sanitize-html` settings could allow certain tags, enabling script injection.
   - Mitigation: Use default `sanitize-html` settings, which strip all tags unless explicitly allowed.

2. **Reflected XSS**:
   - API error messages could include unsanitized input, exploitable in reflected XSS attacks.
   - Mitigation: Ensure API responses are JSON-encoded and exclude raw user input in errors.

3. **Stored XSS in Admin Content**:
   - Compromised admin accounts could inject scripts into `home_title`, `home_subtitle`, or `about_content`.
   - Mitigation: Sanitize admin inputs and consider a WYSIWYG editor with XSS protection.

4. **Local Development Risks**:
   - Local servers may lack HTTPS, increasing risk of data interception.
   - Mitigation: Use tools like `ngrok` for secure local testing with HTTPS.

5. **Render Free Tier Limitations**:
   - Free tier instances may restart, potentially exposing temporary files if not secured.
   - Mitigation: Store SQLite database on a persistent disk and avoid logging sensitive data.

## Recommendations
1. **Add Content Security Policy (CSP)**:
   - Implement CSP headers on Render to restrict script sources.
   - Example: `Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' https://cdn.jsdelivr.net https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com;`

2. **Secure Admin Credentials**:
   - Replace the hardcoded `adminka` password with a strong, environment-variable-based secret.
   - Example: `const adminPassword = process.env.ADMIN_PASSWORD;`
   - Set in Render’s environment variables: `ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_secure_password`.

3. **Enhance Sanitization**:
   - Update `sanitize-html` regularly to patch vulnerabilities.
   - Consider client-side sanitization with `DOMPurify` for additional protection.

4. **Local Testing Security**:
   - Use HTTPS locally with tools like `ngrok` or `localhost.run`.
   - Avoid exposing the local server to the public internet.

5. **Monitor and Log**:
   - Use Render’s logging to detect suspicious activity (e.g., repeated failed logins).
   - Log errors securely, excluding sensitive data like passwords or tokens.

6. **Client-Side Validation**:
   - Add JavaScript validation for inputs (e.g., phone format) before server submission.
   - Example: Validate `phone` with regex in `register()` and `submitOrder()`.

## Conclusion
The "Мой Не Сам" portal is well-protected against XSS through `sanitize-html`, safe output handling, and JWT authentication. Local development and Render deployment are secure with the implemented mitigations, but adding CSP headers, securing admin credentials, and enhancing local testing security will further strengthen the application. Regular dependency updates and Render configuration reviews will ensure ongoing robustness.
